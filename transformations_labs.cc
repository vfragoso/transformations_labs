// This lab will be completed in class. The idea is to review all the
// transformations material we covered in class and practice coding in C++.
// The goal is to implement the functions declared below during class.
// The functions are not well defined, that is, the signatures of the function
// are not final. The second goal of the class is to choose the right signatures
// for the functions that will compute the transformations.
namespace {
// This function will apply the translation transformation to a given input
// point. Modify the signature to get the proper function.
void Translate();

// This function will apply the scaling transformation to a given input point.
void Scale();

// This function will apply a rotation transformation to a given input point.
void Rotate();

// This function builds a rotation matrix that rotates, scales and translates.
void RotateScaleAndTranslate();
}  // namespace

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  // TODO(vfragoso): Implement examples testing the translation, scale, and
  // rotation transformation implementations.
  return 0;
